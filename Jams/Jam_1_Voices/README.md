# Drunk Driving
# By Fiorie Rousselot-Barbe

You had a few drinks before driving your car back home(And you shouldn't have).
Driving under the influence of alcohol is a terrible idea -- But thanfully this is just a simulation!
Try driving the car back home (If you get too confused, you can sober up by looking at the comments in the switch statement in script.js)
