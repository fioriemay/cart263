# Mochi Dres-Up Game

  You are given a scenario describing how Mochi's day is going to look. Describe to her the kind of outfit you think she should
  wear. Try to tell her the vibe of the outfit she should go for, rather than telling her what exactly she should be wearing.
  Mochi is a bit stubborn and hates being told what to do! Simply guide her through the outfit decision.


  The instruction & title page were designed by hand on PhotoShop.
  Mochi and her outfits were created on paper. I drew Mochi first, and then added her outfits with tracing paper. I then
  scanned them and cut them out into PNG's using photoshop.

  I love journaling/scrapbooking and wanted to recreate that vibe through a coding project.
  I was also really interested in mixing mediums, and exploring how digital and traditional mediums can coexist.
